TODO :

* Retrieve all user's mysql grants
* A function to check if my "prod" is the same as my "repo"
* Apply all user's mysql grants
* Apply a single user's mysql grants
* create a new user (also generate password for all environments)
* don't forget sso's database
* send an email to development@virtual-expo.com when applying user's mysql grants

* when retrieving all user's mysql grants, if there is an error --> SEND an alert to exploit. Cause I don't wanna my repo to be BUGGED (I know git is our friend)


when applying user's mysql grants : don't drop the users, revoke all there privilegies
